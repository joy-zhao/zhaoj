					<p> An adult skeletal system not only contains bones but also a large amount of tendons, ligaments and cartilage to support them. This systems performs many vital functions for the body, such as movement, support, protection, blood cells production, as well as the storage of stem cells. In addition, <a href=skeletalsystem.html> bone cells </a> have a special function, which is to deposit calcium phosphate between cells. As the intercellular spaces are filled, the calcium phosphate hardens to give the bone rigidity and strength. </p>
					<h3> Fun Fact! </h3>
					<p> According to the <a href = "https://askabiologist.asu.edu/bone-anatomy"> Arizona State Univerity&#8217;s School Of Life Sciences </a>, only 2% of all animals are vertebrates. In other words, while humans are born with and average of 270 bones, 98% of animals do not have any internal ones. </p>

						<p id="p"> The pulmonary loop is one of the components in the cardiovascular which moves blood back and forth between the heart and the lungs. It carries deoxygenated blood from the the right side of the heart to the lungs, and oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart. This system is named as such because its components are the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins. The systematic loop acts as a messenger between the heart and the rest of the body, sending oxygenated blood out and receiving deoxygenated blood.</p>
